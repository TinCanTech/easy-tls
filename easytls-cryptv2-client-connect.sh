  easytls-cryptv2-client-connect.sh

  This script is intended to be used by tls-crypt-v2 client keys
  generated by EasyTLS.  See: https://github.com/TinCanTech/easy-tls

  Options:
  help|-h|--help      This help text.
  -v|--verbose        Be a lot more verbose at run time (Not Windows).
  -t|--tmp-dir=<path> Temporary directory to load the client hardware list from.
  -s|--pid-file=<FILE>
                      The PID file for the openvpn server instance.
  -a|--allow-no-check If the key has a hardware-address configured
                      and the client did NOT use --push-peer-info
                      then allow the connection.  Otherwise, keys with a
                      hardware-address MUST use --push-peer-info.
  -p|--push-required  Require all clients to use --push-peer-info.
  -k|--key-required   Require all client keys to have a hardware-address.

  Exit codes:
  0   - Allow connection, Client hwaddr is correct or not required.
  1   - Disallow connection, pushed hwaddr does not match.
  2   - Disallow connection, hwaddr required and not pushed.
  3   - Disallow connection, hwaddr required and not keyed.
  4   - Disallow connection, X509 certificate incorrect for this TLS-key.
  5   - Disallow connection, hwaddr verification has not been configured.
  6   - Disallow connection, Server PID does not match daemon_pid.
  7   - Disallow connection, missing value to option.
  8   - Disallow connection, missing X509 client cert serial. (BUG)
  9   - Disallow connection, unexpected failure. (BUG)

  253 - Disallow connection, exit code when --help is called.
  254 - BUG Disallow connection, fail_and_exit() exited with default error code.
  255 - BUG Disallow connection, die() exited with default error code.
