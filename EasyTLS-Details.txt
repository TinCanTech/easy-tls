Easy-TLS in detail


Introduction:

  The main focus of Easy-TLS is to provide an easy way to manage OpenVPN
  and EasyRSA assorted certificates and keys into fully verified 'inline'
  files which can be used immediately.

  The second focus of Easy-TLS is to provide TLS-Crypt-V2 key metadata
  which conforms to the original format as described by syzzer.
    For full details see:
    https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/tls-crypt-v2.txt
    (syzzer's work)


  The third focus is to provide server side scripts to interogate the
  TLS-crypt-v2 metadata and provide options to manage client connections.
  All this can be done prior to exposing x509 code.


Overview:

  * OpenVPN '--tls-crypt-v2' keys and '--tls-crypt-v2-verify' script.

    These are new keys and a new script hook for OpenVPN.


  * Usage:

    To use the 'easytls' script simply copy it to the same directory that
    you have installed easyrsa in.  If you prefer to keep the script in
    a $PATH directory then use option: '--pki-dir=<DIR>' to point the script
    to your working Easy-RSA PKI directory.

    To use the 'easytls-cryptv2-verify.sh' script simply copy it to your server
    scripts directory and use option: '-c|--ca=<PATH>' to point the script
    to your working Easy-RSA PKI directory. This is the same directory as above.

    There is also 'easytls-cryptv2-client-connect.sh' which extends the
    verification process to include client hardware-address lock-down.

    For full help use:
    * ./easytls -h
    * ./easytls-cryptv2-verify.sh -h
    * ./easytls-cryptv2-client-connect.sh -h


Easy-TLS details:

    Easy-TLS plugs directly into Easy-RSA3. This is a hard requirement.
    Once installed into your Easy-RSA3 working directory Easy-TLS can 
    manage the following items:

    * OpenVPN TLS Auth keys: OpenVPN --tls-auth / --key-direction

    * OpenVPN TLS Crypt keys: OpenVPN --tls-crypt

    * OpenVPN TLS Crypt Version 2 keys ** Nice **

    * Manage 'inline' files, including: OpenVPN --tls-crypt-V2

      * Easy-RSA3 x509 Public Key Infra-structure
      * OpenVPN specific TLS keys

    * Provide metadata for TLS-Crypt-V2 keys

    * Provide server side script 'easytls-cryptv2-verify.sh'
      This script uses metadata fields to verify a client certificate
      serial number and CA finger print before exposing any x509 code.
      This is effectively a software configurable firewall for OpenVPN.


TLS-Crypt-v2 client key metadata details:

  * This metadata field is constructed as follows:

    1.  Four part field.

        TLS-Crypt-V2 key serial number. (SHA256 or SHA1)
        EG: 4504cc7595f802344e7200c11fc1586f06fe18d546e8343abbe2b53ee1edfa90

        A 32bit random padding string. EG: 4d76a07e

        Easy-TLS identifier string: 'easytls'

        EasyTLS metadata version string: "$EASYTLS_VERSION". EG: 1.27

        Example:
        4504cc7595f802344e7200c11fc1586f06fe18d546e8343abbe2b53ee1edfa90-4d76a07e--easytls-1.27

    2   Two part field.

        CA Fingerprint. (Formatted to one contiguous string, CA-Identity)
        EG: 2859809249AF76AADE8C585406380DF303A9C212AB91100A10D71B20319CA253

        Server X509 certificate CommonName. EG: s01

        Example:
        2859809249AF76AADE8C585406380DF303A9C212AB91100A10D71B20319CA253-s01

    3.  Client X509 certificate serial-number.
        EG: 1607AD45763A27B447F67578C1B815F2

    4.  Creation-date. (date +%s - "Seconds since...")
        EG: 1617216408

    5.  User definable Custom-Group.
        This is a string which the user can use for identification:
        EG: "CompanyName" (One contiguous string)

    6.  Client X509 certificate CommonName.
        EG: c09

    7.  TLS-CryptV2 key name.
        This allows clients to have an unlimited number of keys
        associated with their single X509 certificate.
        EG: Home

    8.  Unused field.

    9.  Hardware-address-list.
        EG: +EF1234567890+1234567890FE+


EasyTLS verification scripts:

  * easytls-cryptv2-verify.sh (OpenVPN --tls-crypt-v2-verify)

      Verify TLS-Crypt-V2 key metadata:
      Key age, key serial number, key status (enabled/disabled), Custom-Group.
      Optional X509 certificate checks. (Details below)

  * easytls-verify.sh (OpenVPN --tls-verify)

      Full TLS layer verification stage. 

  * easytls-cryptv2-client-connect.sh (OpenVPN --client-connect)

      Verify client hardware-address.


  * Optional X509 verification methods:

    1. Verify via CRL --via-crl

       The CRL is searched for client serial number and the client 
       connection is dropped if the client is found to be revoked.
       This is the default method and conforms to syzzers original
       specification.

    2. Verify via CA --via-ca (Not enabled)

       The client serial number status is verified via OpenSSL CA.
       This method does not work because OpenSSL returns an inorrect
       status code.

    3. Verify via openssl index.txt --via-index (Preferred)

       The client serial number status is verified via the OpenSSL
       index.txt file.

       Option --cache-id reads the CA Identity file from disk,
       instead of loading openssl to generate the CA fingerprint.
       
       Option --preload-cache-id="CA_ID" allows the server config to load
       the CA Identity from the command line as a parameter, eliminating
       the need to read the CA Identity file from disk, repeatedly.

       CA Identity is the openssl output for the CA fingerprint formatted
       to one contiguous string:

       * openssl fingerprint output:  'SHA1 Fingerprint=95:DC:42:...'
       * EasyTLS CA Identity format:  '95DC42...'

       Example configuration command to use in an OpenVPN config file:

       NOTE: This example is wrapped at line length, in your config file it
       must not be wrapped.  Also, OpenVPN does not expand variables in a
       config file, so all paths and options must be exanded in full.

       tls-cryptv2-verify '/home/tct/easyrsa3/tls-crypt-v2-verify.sh -v
         -c=/home/tct/easyrsa3/pki2 -g=tincantech --verify-via-index
         -t=365 --preload-cache-id=E19982D9C063CEC74F66B7D31BF7B9306A609A8E'


Note about exit codes:

  OpenVPN --log does not accept data from scripts under Windows
  so the exit codes are absolutely necessary to debug errors.
