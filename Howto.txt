EasyTLS HOWTO:

Introduction:

  The main focus of Easy-TLS is to provide an easy way to manage OpenVPN
  and EasyRSA assorted certificates and keys into fully verified 'inline'
  files which can be used immediately.

  The second focus of Easy-TLS is to provide TLS-crypt-v2 key metadata
  which conforms to the original format as described by syzzer.
  (See full details below)

  The third focus is to provide a server side script to verify TLS crypt v2
  metadata and manage a disabled list, all prior to exposing x509 code.

Overview:


  * OpenVPN --tls-crypt-v2 keys and --tls-crypt-v2-verify script.

    This is a *new* script hook for OpenVPN.

    For full details see:
    https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/tls-crypt-v2.txt
    (syzzer's work)


  * Easy-TLS

    Easy-TLS plugs directly into Easy-RSA3. This is a hard requirement.
    Once installed into your Easy-RSA3 working directory Easy-TLS can 
    manage the following items:

    * OpenVPN TLS Auth keys: OpenVPN --tls-auth / --key-direction

    * OpenVPN TLS Crypt keys: OpenVPN --tls-crypt

    * OpenVPN TLS Crypt Version 2 keys ** Nice **

    * Manage 'inline' files, including:

      * Easy-RSA3 x509 Public Key Infra-structure
      * OpenVPN specific TLS keys

    * Provide metadata for TLS-crypt-v2 keys

    * Provide server side script tls-crypt-v2-verify.sh
      This script uses meatadata fields to verify a client certificate
      serial number and CA finger print before exposing any x509 code.
      This is effectively a software configurable firewall for OpenVPN.


TLS Crypt v2 details:

  * TLS Crypt v2 client key metadata

    This metadata field is constructed as follows:

    1. metadata_version string: "metadata_version_easytls_A4"

    2. CA Fingerprint (Formatted to one contiguous string)

    3. Client certificate serial number

    4. Client certificate Common Name

    5. User definable custom group

       This is a string which the user can use for identification
       eg. "CompanyName" (One contiguous string)

  * TLS Crypt v2 disabled list

    Use this list to temporarily drop specific client connections.

  * TLS Crypt v2 verification method

    1. Verify via CRL

       The CRL is searched for client serial number and the client 
       connection is dropped if the client is found to be revoked.
       This is the default method which conforms to syzzers original
       specification.

    2. Verify via CA

       The client serial number status is verified via `openssl ca`
       This method works but is not recommended by OpenSSL.


Note about exit codes:

  OpenVPN --log does not accept data from scripts under Windblows
  so the exit codes are absolutely necessary to debug errors.


Note: I am not very good at documentation
