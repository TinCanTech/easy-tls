EasyTLS HOWTO:

Introduction:

  The main focus of Easy-TLS is to provide an easy way to manage OpenVPN
  and EasyRSA assorted certificates and keys into fully verified 'inline'
  files which can be used immediately.

  The second focus of Easy-TLS is to provide TLS-crypt-v2 key metadata
  which conforms to the original format as described by syzzer.
  (See full details below)

  The third focus is to provide a server side script to verify TLS crypt v2
  metadata and manage a disabled list, all prior to exposing x509 code.


Overview:

  * OpenVPN --tls-crypt-v2 keys and --tls-crypt-v2-verify script.

    These are new keys and a new script hook for OpenVPN.

    For full details see:
    https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/tls-crypt-v2.txt
    (syzzer's work)


  * Easy-TLS

    Easy-TLS plugs directly into Easy-RSA3. This is a hard requirement.
    Once installed into your Easy-RSA3 working directory Easy-TLS can 
    manage the following items:

    * OpenVPN TLS Auth keys: OpenVPN --tls-auth / --key-direction

    * OpenVPN TLS Crypt keys: OpenVPN --tls-crypt

    * OpenVPN TLS Crypt Version 2 keys ** Nice **

    * Manage 'inline' files, including:

      * Easy-RSA3 x509 Public Key Infra-structure
      * OpenVPN specific TLS keys

    * Provide metadata for TLS-crypt-v2 keys

    * Provide server side script tls-crypt-v2-verify.sh
      This script uses meatadata fields to verify a client certificate
      serial number and CA finger print before exposing any x509 code.
      This is effectively a software configurable firewall for OpenVPN.


TLS Crypt v2 details:

  * TLS Crypt v2 client key metadata

    This metadata field is constructed as follows:

    1.  metadata_version string: "metadata_version_easytls"
        (No longer use a specific version because it was to easy to change)

    2.a CA Fingerprint (Formatted to one contiguous string)

    2.b "CA Identity"

        If the CA Fingerprint is used only then every field in the metadata
        string can be verified via public sources or, in the case of the
        Custom Group, be guessed with some reasonable degree of success.

        CA Identity allows secret data to be shared in the metadata field.
        This secret data *cannot* be verified, guessed or impersonated.

        CA Identity construction:

            'SHA512_Identity=$ca_identity'

        ca_identity field construction:

            $( openssl sha512
               $(
                  openssl sha256 easyrsa3/pki/ca.crt
                  openssl sha256 easyrsa3/pki/easytls/easytls-ca-identity.txt
                )
             ) # EOL

        easytls-ca-identity.txt:

            $( openssl -rand -hex -out easytls/easytls-ca-identity.txt 64 )


    3.  Client certificate serial number

    4.  Client certificate Common Name

    5.  User definable custom group

        This is a string which the user can use for identification
        eg. "CompanyName" (One contiguous string)

  * TLS Crypt v2 disabled list

    Use this list to temporarily drop specific client connections.

  * TLS Crypt v2 verification method

    1. Verify via CRL

       The CRL is searched for client serial number and the client 
       connection is dropped if the client is found to be revoked.
       This is the default method which conforms to syzzers original
       specification.

    2. Verify via CA

       The client serial number status is verified via `openssl ca`
       This method works but is not recommended by OpenSSL.


Note about exit codes:

  OpenVPN --log does not accept data from scripts under Windblows
  so the exit codes are absolutely necessary to debug errors.


Howto resolve issues with Invalid .inline files:

  If you receive a message informing you that you have "Revoked certs"
  then simply use './easytls inline-remove <filename-base>'
  This will delete the offending file and keep the EasyTLS index up-to-date.
  Invalid files are caused by x509 certificates which have been revoked.
  The .inline file is of no further value if the certificate has been revoked.

  If you receive a message informing you that you have "Renewed certs"
  then simply use './easytls inline-renew <filename-base>'
  This will delete the offending file and keep the EasyTLS index up-to-date
  and then recreate a new .inline file from the renewed certificate
  and keep the EasyTLS index up-to-date.


Howro resolve issues with the EasyTLS inline-index:

  In the unlikely event that something does go wrong with the EasyTLS Inline Index
  then simply use './easytls inline-index-rebuild'
  EasyTLS will attempt to rebuild your index.  (Please report issues on github)
