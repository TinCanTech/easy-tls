# Standard Features
Easy-TLS is an Easy-RSA extension utility to help manage:
+ Easy-RSA based x509 security credentials
+ OpenVPN specific TLS keys
+ Verified `Inline` files for use with OpenVPN
+ Concise OpenVPN TLS-Crypt-V2 Client Key Metadata definition
+ X509 Certificate **and matched** Easy-TLS Inline-file Expiry management tools
+ Complete **Inter-active Menus**

# Additional Features
Easy-TLS also supports No-CA mode, which does not require an Easy-RSA CA:
+ Use Easy-TLS to build **self-signed** X509 Certificates and keys.

Easy-TLS scripts to interogate EasyTLS-CryptV2 metadata:
+ `easytls-cryptv2-verify.sh` - TLS-Crypt-V2 key metadata access policy tool.
+ `easytls-verify.sh` - TLS and X509 level access policy tool.
+ `easytls-client-connect.sh` - Hardware-address access policy tool.

## Installation
Download: [**`easytls`**](https://github.com/TinCanTech/easy-tls/blob/master/easytls) and [**`easytls-openssl.cnf`**](https://github.com/TinCanTech/easy-tls/blob/master/easytls-openssl.cnf) to your `easyrsa3` working directory.

For full support, you will also need these scripts for use by your OpenVPN Server:
+ [**`easytls-cryptv2-verify.sh`**](https://github.com/TinCanTech/easy-tls/blob/master/easytls-cryptv2-verify.sh)<br>
  This script is used by Openvpn-Server to manage TLS-Crypt-V2 Metadata access policy rules.<br>
  Also required for EasyTLS hardware-address access policy rules.

+ [**`easytls-verify.sh`**](https://github.com/TinCanTech/easy-tls/blob/master/easytls-verify.sh)<br>
  This script is  is used by Openvpn-Server to manage TLS verification.<br>
  Also required for EasyTLS hardware-address access policy rules.

+ [**`easytls-client-connect.sh`**](https://github.com/TinCanTech/easy-tls/blob/master/easytls-client-connect.sh)<br>
  This script is used by Openvpn-Server to manage hardware-address access policy rules.

## Environment
`easytls` is intended to work **everywhere** that `openvpn` and `easyrsa` work.

## Requirements
+ Easy-RSA Version 3.0.6+
+ OpenVPN Version 2.5.0+

Easy-TLS is *written in the style of* and *borrows heavily from* Easy-RSA <br>

**Note:** <br>
This is intended to facilitate maximum compatibility with Easy-RSA while extending functionality <br>
to include direct support for OpenVPN specific TLS keys and Inline credentials. <br>
